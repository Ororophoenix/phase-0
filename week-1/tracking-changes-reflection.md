•	What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?
o	A pull request is changes made to a repository that is now available to others on Github. You create a pull request by pushing a branch into a Github repository. Once the branch is already on Github pulling it is simple. You click pull request. Select the base fork (master) and the compare (branch). Then finish by clicking create pull request. To merge click merge pull request this should be an option directly after the pull request. Follow by deleting the extra branch. 
•	Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?
o	Pull request is good for teams because it helps with code review, keeps the “tree” simple by deleting unnecessary branches and allows for easy merging with other branches.
