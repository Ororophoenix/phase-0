What does puts do?
	Puts writes on the screen whatever comes after it. So that could be the solution to a math problem or a string.

What is an integer? What is a float?
	An integer is a whole number. A float is a number with a decimal point.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you
explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
	When you use division with integers, ruby will only return integers. So 9/2 will return 4 instead of the mathematically correct answer of 4.5.
```ruby
puts 24*365
puts (((60*24)*365)*10)
```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
  Ruby addition, subtraction and multiplication commands works as expected. You input the +, -, * sign, respectively, and it computes the answer. Division in ruby is different because it can recieve two answers. If dividing integers (whole numbers) ruby will only return an integer. WHen dividing floats ruby is capable of give correct answers with decimal points.

What is the difference between integers and floats?
  An integer is a whole number (a number without a decimal point). A float is a number with a decimal point.
What is the difference between integer and float division?
  When dividing a integer ruby can only return an integer. When dividing floats ruby returns answers with decimal point.
What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
  Strings are groups of letters, numbers,punctuation and essentially anything else you want thrown into it. You can use strings to make sentences, recieve informaiton for a program, or return information to a user.
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
  Local variables are variables that live inside a method and cannot leave. You would use them when you needed to define a method that you do not want to interfere with other parts of your code.
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
  The most difficult part was understanding how to work ruby using the terminal.
