2.	What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
1.	Well right now it has no purpose except to just be a hello. In the future hopefully it will be a place I can display my work to future employers and use essentially as a portfolio. With my mental health background it is likely that any projects I attempt by myself will have to do with that. 
3.	What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
1.	My target audience’s interests would be in my and any projects that I design. So that could be future employers who want to see examples of my work or if I do make a program related to mental health my audience’s interest will likely also be in mental health. I tend to be very personal in my writing so I see myself addressing 
4.	What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
1.	I want my users to look at my portfolio and contact me. 
5.	What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
1.	Some main things to know about design is color scheme, page layout, and the ability to navigate the website easily.
6.	What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
1.	User experience design is the field of constructing websites based on what the target audience would like best. It is valuable because for any website to be successful it needs viewers. A website needs to be easy to navigate and have clear language for a user to interact with the content. The more comfortable a user feels with the website the more likely it will be that they will use it.
7.	Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
1.	Trying to understand using markdown and the relative path was the most difficult for me.
