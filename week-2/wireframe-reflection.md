##What is a wireframe?
o	A wireframe is a blueprint for websites. 
##What are the benefits of wireframing?
o	Similar to an architectural model a wireframe gives the designer a better idea of what the website will look like when the content has been added. It also give the designer the ability to determine if the website will be cluttered or easy to navigate before doing all the work of putting the information in to only delete it later. 
##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
o	I did. It is fun trying to picture the finished site and taking it all the way back to the basics. At the end of this process I want a site that reflects who I am and just placing shapes on the wireframing tool let me explore different parts of my personality. My index page and blog page feel completely different even though it’s just the outline. 
##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
o	I stuck with my first idea which surprised me. I normally change my mind a lot when it comes to details because I want to keep adding things or changing something. I really liked the look and feel of my original idea so I kept that. 
##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
o	I kept wondering if there was a certain etiquette for wireframing. It seems pretty informal but coding tends to be very specific about details. I read through the beginner’s guide to wireframing again and I felt better that my idea did not look like the rest. 
##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
o	 I enjoyed the quick sketching I did of the index page before creating it on the computer. Making all of the lines and boxes with the text was the most tedious. I wanted everything to be symmetrical so I kept resizing this stupid circle and even now I still feel like it looks lumpy!
