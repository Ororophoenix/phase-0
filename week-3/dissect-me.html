      Over the past week at DBC I have been stuffing my brain with concept after concept and what I know beyond a shadow of a doubt is that version control is important! Everybody had that one incident in high school or college when you were three pages into a five page paper and somehow, someway, by some nefarious trick of satan. Boom! Your paper is gone. Never to be seen or heard from again, with no way to recover it and no hope of sleep for the next two days. Well, version control fights that with commits.

      Git allows you to keep track of changes by using frequent commits. Commits are screenshots of your work. Good programmers add notes into their code but git also allows you to write commit messages. Commit messages are helpful because they state what the programmer was working on at the time of the commit. This allows you to come back to a previous commit (screenshot) and know what needs to be worked on.

      Github is the candy land of coding. Except itâ€™s free, which makes it even better. Github allows you to access your code from anywhere. It also allows coders to share their source code with others to get feedback or to be inspired. Github offers a platform for beginning, intermediate and advanced developers to join together and learn from each other in a supportive community.

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	I used meta charset and section but that was all. I am still getting used to html5 so I have not used any of the tags that often. 
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	Elements get displayed from top down. THe browser reads the html document and places the content is the order that it presents from parent down. 
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	I just found out what snippets are. When he showed me the first one I was so mad because that would have been useful days ago haha! I definitely see myself creating more snippets as time goes by. They are really useful when creating things like this. I know that I want to create a standard setup for my blog posts so I think I will create the format using snippet. That way I wont have to keep looking back and forth. I would love to know about more shortcuts. I am reading the html/css book and that has a lot of good information in it. -->
